VERSION 1 (Direct):

Hi Mr. Nilekani,

I'm building "India's Property UPI" - applying your Payment UPI playbook to real estate's ₹7.55L Cr market.

The problem: ₹45,000 Cr/year lost to black money (no transaction transparency). Same issue you solved in payments.

My solution: National platform that owns infrastructure + integrates 28 state IGR portals + makes every transaction transparent.

I've built the complete model (government partnership strategy, working demos, ₹60 Cr ARR potential). Following your NPCI approach: govt-backed + private execution.

Not seeking funding - just 30 mins of your guidance:
→ How did you navigate govt partnerships without bureaucratic delays?
→ What mistakes should I avoid?

Can I share a 10-slide deck?

Your UPI revolutionized payments. Can we do the same for real estate?

Thank you,

VERSION 2 (Softer, More Personal):

Hi Mr. Nilekani,

Your UPI journey has been my blueprint. I've spent months studying how you built govt partnership + private innovation for payments.

Now I'm attempting the same for real estate: "India's Property UPI" - a transparency platform that could recover ₹45,000 Cr in black money annually.

I've built:
✓ Complete business model (₹60 Cr ARR potential)
✓ Government partnership strategy (using your PPP playbook)
✓ Working demos of all systems

I don't need funding. I need 30 minutes to ask:
- How did you navigate govt buy-in at scale?
- What would you do differently?

Would you be open to a brief call? I'd be honored to share what I've built.

Thank you for inspiring this,
[Your Name]

VERSION 3 (Question-First Approach):

Hi Mr. Nilekani,

Quick question: If you were to apply the UPI model to real estate (₹7.55L Cr market), how would you structure the government partnership?

Context: I'm building "India's Property UPI" - a transparency platform that could recover ₹45,000 Cr/year in black money. Following your NPCI playbook: owned infrastructure + state portal integration + govt-backed credibility.

I have working demos + complete govt partnership strategy, but I'm stuck on execution sequencing (which state first? how to avoid bureaucratic delays?).

30 mins of your time would save me 6 months of mistakes.

Can I share a brief deck?

Thank you,

RECOMMENDED: Use VERSION 3 (Question-first)
Why: Opens with intellectual curiosity (he loves solving problems), shows you've done homework, specific ask (30 mins, not vague).
